# Maze-Solving Robot
# This code finds the shortest path to the center of a maze. The Python code can be run on a Raspberry Pi by students interested in learning how to develop a maze-solving robot for the IEEE micromouse student competition. Additional sensors on the robot are required to make the robot fully autonomous.
